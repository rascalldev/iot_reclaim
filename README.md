# iot_reclaim
Liberating vendor locked iot devices to OS firmware.

iot_reclaim is a project to document and support users/recyclers in updating vendor locked IOT devices at risk of or already victim to vendor absondonment.

The main goals of this project are to:
- Discover high impact devices abandoned by their vendor (or at risk of)
- Research, document, and improve the process for users/recyclers to use the devices with an open source platform (ESPHome, Home Assistant)
- Advocate for government and vendor support in practices for product end of support to reduce e-waste  

The priority should be mass produced devices at risk of or already victim to vendor abandonment. Some examples are the . While also providing vendor SDKs as PlatformIO cores,
the project focuses on developing working Arduino-compatible cores for supported families. The cores are inspired by Espressif's official core for ESP32,
which should make it easier to port/run existing ESP apps on less-common, unsupported IoT modules.

**There's an [ESPHome port](https://docs.libretiny.eu/docs/projects/esphome/) based on LibreTiny, which supports BK7231 and RTL8710B chips.**

**Note:** this project is work-in-progress.
